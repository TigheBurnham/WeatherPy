# WeatherPy

## Overview 

In this project we performed an API call with OpenWeatherMap to determine four optimal cities to plan a vacation based on their minimum and maximum temperatures of 72 degrees and 90 degrees respectively. In order to map out a route between the cities and hotels that fall within this temperature range the program also utilized Google Maps Directions API.

## Summary

Based on the results it was determined that some of the four best cities within the same country that met the temperature requirements were San Francisco, Salinas, San Ramon, and Laguna. The Google Maps image above was created to illustrate the driving route advised for this trip. Another key variable that could be added to this app would be looking into pricing options based on the hotels and forms of travel.
